# Software-Defined Data Center Course 
INFR-4621 @ontariotechu

## Course Description

This course presents a comprehensive overview of key design factors for modern software-defined data centers (SDDC). The course covers the following topics: SDDC architecture and building blocks; Cloud strategies and enabling technologies; principles of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV); Storage-Area networks (SAN); Openflow, VXLAN and other SDDC-related protocols; IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework for cloud management and service assurance; Data center security and high availability (HA); Scalability, Capacity management and Resource Allocation; Orchestration and automation; Advanced data center technologies.


## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:
1. Examine and compare the differences between traditional and software-defined data centers
2. Analyze requirements for data center services
3. Architect technical solutions for software-defined components based on a given scenario
4. Apply and deploy enabling technologies such as SDN, SDC, SDS, NFV, etc.
5. Assess a basic disaster recovery plan using industry standards (e.g. NIST 800-34)
